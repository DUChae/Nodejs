# Description
A repository that builds the foundation of node.js and takes notes through md. 

# Detail

> [URL](Basic%20Knowledge/URL.md)
> <br/> The URL (Uniform Resource Locator) module provides utilities for parsing, formatting, and resolving web addresses, making it easier to handle tasks such as HTTP requests.


> [CRUD](Basic%20Knowledge/CRUD.md)
> <br/> CRUD, essential for data management, stands for Create (adding new data), Read (retrieving data), Update (modifying existing data), and Delete (removing data)


> [Note Code Until 2024.6.13](Record/2024.6.13.md)
> <br/> This code sets up an HTTP server using Node.js to dynamically generate HTML pages by reading files based on query parameters.


> [Get File Read](Record/GetFileRead.md)
> <br/> This code asynchronously reads and logs the list of files and directories in the specified `./data` folder using Node.js's `fs` module.


> [Sync & Async](Record/Sync&Async.md)
> <br/> Explored the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming through simple code examples and understood its importance.


> [Callback](Record/Callback.md)
> <br/> A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed within the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.


> [Package Manager & PM2](Record/PackageManager&PM2.md)
> <br/> A package manager manages the installation, update, and removal of software packages, crucial for system functionality. NPM is widely used in Node.js, while PM2 manages running Node.js applications, automatically restarting them on failure and reloading on code changes.


> [Create a Post Creation UI](Record/Create%20a%20Post%20Creation%20UI.md)
> <br/> This Node.js code handles requests to the `/create` path by reading the `./data` directory, generating a list of files, and responding with an HTML form that allows users to submit a new title and description.
